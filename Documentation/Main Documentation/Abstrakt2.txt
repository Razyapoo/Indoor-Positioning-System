In contrast, UWB operates on a wider range of frequencies, utilizes short-duration pulses for communication, and has low power spectral density [44, “A Gaussian Pulse Generator for Ultra-WideBand Radar System”], which allows for more efficient elimination of signal interference. Research shows that, in general, UWB technology outperforms BLE 5.1 in complex environments with obstructed lines of sight and significant multipath effects [48, Direction Finding with UWB and BLE: A Comparative Study].

Given that the main use cases of our application are in industrial environments and hospitals, which utilize many other technologies operating on radio frequencies, we opted for UWB technology, as it handles multipath interference more effectively. We chose an ESP32 board integrated with a UWB chip from Makerfabs [45]. This board is compatible with the Arduino IDE [46], which simplifies the process of writing and uploading scripts for anchors and tags."
