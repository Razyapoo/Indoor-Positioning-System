# Ideas

## How to measure human height?

- use average height for every person
- Use reference point to calculate (pixel to cm ratio is needed). Once a person will walk around the reference point, it will be possible to compute actual height of that person. And at the beginning just use approximate height of a person.

## Improving accuracy of distance calculation

- place cameras at different angle, in different directions or/and at different locations. Run distance calculation on each video,synchronize them and see if distance on every video is same.
