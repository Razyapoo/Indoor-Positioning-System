# Scenario 2

## Equipment

- 3 actors
- 3 tags 
- 3 cameras
- 2 anchors

## Details

- Distance between A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> is 10 m
- Distance between T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> is 2 m
- Distance between T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> is 3 m

    <em>Figure 1. Schema of the Scenario 2</em>
</p>

Figure 1 above shows a possible scenario of an experiment. There are 3 actors, each having a tag in the pocket. Cameras C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> and anchors A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are placed on the cabinets. The distance between C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> (resp. A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>) is equal to 10 m. Anchors are placed above actors.

Camera C<sub>3</sub> is placed in the corner next to the front door. Camera C<sub>1</sub> is filming in the direction of front door. Cameras C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> are filming in the direction opposite to C<sub>1</sub>.

Distance between walking paths of Actor 1 and Actor 2 is equal to 2 m that corresponds to the violated distance according to COVID19 restrictions.

All actors are moving along the dashed line shown on the Figure 1. Actor A1 and Actor A2 walk in opposite directions. 

Actor 3 is additional, but not necessary.

## Goal

The goal of the experiment is to detect violated social distance (2 m) between each pair of actors (tags). Difficulty here is that both cameras should detect back of the head of each person.
